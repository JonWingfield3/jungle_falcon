Jungle Falcon -- A RISC-V CPU simulator written in C++
Author: Jon Wingfield

Info:
This project was done during a course project from CU Boulder's ECEN 4593 (Computer Organization). The final project goal was to create a cycle accurate RISC-V CPU simulation which includes a 5-stage pipeline and configurable caches.

Contents:
  sim 
    -- source code for the simluation: cpu, memory, pipeline, register file, cache, etc.

  testing 
    -- unit tests created using gtest framework

  c 
    -- C programs used as input to sim

  asm 
    -- ASM programs used as input to sim
