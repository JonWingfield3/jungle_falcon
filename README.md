Jungle Falcon -- a Risc V CPU simulator written in C++
author: Jon Wingfield

Info:
This project was started during a course project from CU Boulder's ECEN 4593 (Computer Organization). The final project goal was to create a cycle accurate riscv cpu simulation which includes a 5-stage pipeline and L1 cache. It has been expanded to include a GUI, some simulated hardware peripherals, and a debugging unit.
